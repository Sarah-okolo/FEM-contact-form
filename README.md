- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) - Custom form management hook
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Schema validation library
- [Shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - UI components library
 

### What I learned

In this project, I learned the following:

- How to use **React Hook Form** to handle forms along with **Zod** for field validation.
- How to use Shadcn's **RadioGroup** and **Checkbox** component to create radio and checkbox inputs in the form.
- How to use react hook form's **Controller** component to handle complex fields or Shadcn's custom form fields validation registrations.

### Useful resources

- [React Hook form (with Zod)](https://youtu.be/cc_xmawJ8Kg?si=siEkY5Uby5qeXuIa) - This helped me learn about how to make use of react hook form and how to integrate zod validation to it.
